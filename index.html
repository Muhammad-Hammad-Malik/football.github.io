		football is love , football is life and what is football without
		all the world class clubs that are playing in the top 5 european 
		leagues . This site will take a look at the top 5 clubs on football 
		history along with the current best players of that club. These world class players entertain masses with their skills as well as their near-robotic playstyles .Some of them are legends on and off the pitch with contributing alot to the club by mentoring other young acadmey players and inspiring the people to start following the beautiful game as I was also once inspired by watching an eccentric goalkeeper having the strangest of playstyles.
